# Responsive-Portfolio


## update 3 11/20
I mainly updated the portfolio page today, but plan on overahuling the rest of the site over the next break to match the theme of portfolio page.
added new projects. 
updated page icons with gifs for readyup/gify.


## functionality

links may not work on all of the assignments/projects. (press github icon below each image to direct to respective repo).
